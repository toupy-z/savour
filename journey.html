                <p>This is our first market! The atmosphere was buzzing with energy, and there were loads of stalls showcasing their own creative ideas and products. The competition was intense, and although we didn't take home any awards, we learned something even more valuable: <b>confidence</b>. We used this experience to <b>reflect</b> and understand what we can <b>improve</b> for future markets.</p>

                <p>We took everything we learned from our last market and put it into action. With more confidence, better communication, and a stronger pitch, we connected with our customers more easily. We were thrilled to win the <b>Best Product</b> award and see our progress come to life.</p>

                </header>
                <p>We were proud to represent our team at the London East Showcase, where we presented our business to a panel of expert judges at BNY. It was an exciting but nerve-wracking experience, as we had to deliver a full presentation and answer questions about our product, mission, and progress so far. As a result, we won <b>Best Presentation</b>, <b>Finalist</b>, and <b>Best Company</b>. It was an unforgettable moment that showed us how far we've come and motivated us to keep going even stronger.</p>

                <p>This was another great experience where our team members could gather an insight into the corporate world and experience a London business atmosphere. With more competition, we were nervous but we won the <b>Best Company Runner Up Award</b> at BCLP, a well-known law firm.</p>

                <p>We were so grateful to be able to visit the <b>Amazon Headquarters</b> to present to professional judges. With all the other teams being from private schools, we were pround to be the only state school that made it this far! But sadly all good things must come to an end, and we didn't win any awards. We are so grateful to everyone who supported us, and we learned a lot about business! <b>Packet In!</b>♻️✨</p>
